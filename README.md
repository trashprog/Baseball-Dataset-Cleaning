# Baseball-Dataset-Cleaning

This is another assignment from my Data Wrangling module, this assignment builds upon the data preprocessing and transformation steps performed in the Song Popularity dataset but also simulates extracting useful tables from a large database (~20 files). A simple model was built (classification) to evaluate the performance to see if the cleaning was done properly
